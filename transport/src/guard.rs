//! Connect-time destination guard: refuse to hand the connector a private address.
//!
//! ## Why this lives at the resolver, not at the caller
//!
//! The obvious place to check a destination is where the target is accepted, and
//! for a control plane that is right. It is not sufficient for an engine, for two
//! reasons that a pre-check structurally cannot cover:
//!
//!   * **Redirects.** A public host the caller was allowed to reach can answer
//!     `302 http://10.0.0.5:8080/`. The pre-check saw the first hostname and
//!     nothing else. Following that redirect reaches an arbitrary internal host
//!     AND port, once per request.
//!   * **Rebinding.** A pre-check resolves once; the connector resolves again.
//!     A name whose record flips between the two passes the check and connects
//!     somewhere else.
//!
//! A resolver hook has neither gap, because it is the thing the connector asks
//! for an address, on every connection, including every redirect hop. Whatever
//! it does not return cannot be dialled.
//!
//! ## Why filtering rather than rejecting
//!
//! A name that resolves to both a public and a private address is not
//! necessarily hostile: split-horizon DNS and dual-homed hosts do this. Handing
//! back only the public addresses is both more permissive for those and STRICTER
//! against an attacker, because the connector never receives an internal address
//! to try. Rejecting the whole name would be the weaker choice dressed up as the
//! stricter one.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Off by default. Engines are supposed to reach arbitrary customer targets, and
//! a customer scanning their own RFC1918 network from a node inside it is the
//! product working. This is for the paths where the caller is anonymous and the
//! egress is shared: the free public tools. `ClientConfig::block_internal` turns
//! it on, and nothing else should.
