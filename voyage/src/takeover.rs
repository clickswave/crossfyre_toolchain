//! Dangling-CNAME / subdomain-takeover detection.
//!
//! A takeover happens when a host still points at a third-party service that no
//! longer serves it: `blog.example.com` CNAMEs to a Heroku app that was deleted,
//! so anyone who registers that app name now serves content on `example.com`.
//!
//! Two independent signals, in descending order of confidence:
//!
//!   1. **The CNAME target does not resolve at all** (NXDOMAIN). This is proof on
//!      its own, no HTTP needed and no service fingerprint needed: the record
//!      points into nothing. It is also the case most checkers miss, because they
//!      only match against a service list and give up when the provider is not on
//!      it. We report it whether or not we recognise the provider.
//!
//!   2. **The service answers with its "this host is unclaimed" page.** The target
//!      resolves, so signal 1 is silent, but the provider is serving a known
//!      not-configured response. This needs both a CNAME match and a body match:
//!      matching on the body alone produces false positives on any site that
//!      happens to quote the string.
//!
//! `Status` records what a match actually means today, which is the part that
//! rots. Many providers added domain verification precisely to kill this class,
//! so a matching fingerprint on one of those is a misconfiguration to clean up
//! rather than a live takeover. Reporting those as critical is how a checker
//! loses the reader's trust, so they are graded separately.
//!
//! Fingerprints go stale as providers change their 404 pages. `Status::EdgeCase`
//! and the body strings both need periodic review; a stale entry produces a
//! confident wrong answer, which is worse than no answer.
