//! Authorization testing (BOLA / BFLA / broken authentication) - open-core boundary.
//!
//! Given a set of endpoints and a set of identities (each a role + resolved auth
//! context), the engine replays every endpoint as every identity and compares the
//! responses to detect authorization flaws (broken authentication, BFLA, BOLA/IDOR,
//! BOPLA excessive-data-exposure).
//!
//! This module's public surface is the job's input schema ([`AuthzParams`]) and a
//! single [`run`] entry point. The differential identity-matrix oracle that powers
//! it - privilege-aware pairing, confirm-before-report, the BOPLA data-exposure
//! probe, and the correctness tuning that keeps false positives near zero - is a
//! private drop-in (`private.rs`, git-ignored) that `build.rs` selects when it is
//! present (first-party builds). A public checkout has only `baseline.rs`, so the
//! open build compiles and runs but does not perform the authorization oracle:
//! authorization testing is a platform feature.
//!
//! Both impls expose the same `run(AuthzParams, tx)` surface, so `daemon.rs` is
//! identical regardless of which is compiled.

// keeps the open build warning-clean without pretending fields it ignores don't exist.
